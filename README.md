DOCUMENTAATION FOR MY PROJECT | Third Year - First Semester

-WEB SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS-
This is a personal poertfolio project wherein you are required to only use HTML and CSS

-First of all, starting this porject was the hardest part for me , as I coundn't easily decide for how the design will look.
Which then results to having a lot of back and forth in the process of making even just the design.

-Integrating the responsiveness is the major challenge. This is like the third file I have restared to work on  as I keep on making 
big mistakes on the previous files.
